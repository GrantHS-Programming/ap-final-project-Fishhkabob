# AP Computer Science A Final Project
Name: Finnian McGarvey

Augmented Reality

Okayyyyy where to start. Heyo I'm Finn AKA Fishhkabob and a student at Grant highschool. This project is a weird one. Let's talk about Augmented Reality!
Augmented Reality, also known as AR is when you put a display over real life things I don't want to go full apple vision pro buuuut, I don't want to five minutes craft this shit. 
There are a multitude of ways to make AR ranging from a 20 dollar projector and car window tint, to tony stark jarvis style glasses
I'm just a highschooler not a literal super hero, but I'm also pretty invested in this so it's going to be somewhere in the middle. 
If I continue Computer Science next year you'll probably get to see a interactable AR display which would be cooool as shit in my opinion.

Prototyping:
For now I am going to be using safety glasses window tint and a low will to live.
It migghhhtttt take a while and realistically it's not gonna go aywhere in the six weeks I have until the end of school. So, it will project the time, day, and battery percentge as just purely proof of concept

V1:
planning to attactc a bulky ass 3d printed thingamabobber to the outside of my glasses with the same time, day, battery life.

V2: 
a more streamline mount upgrading to an arduino nano nd making the screen more customizable. new HUD features and possibly a small interactable camera.
Whatever I probs won't get here for a while
