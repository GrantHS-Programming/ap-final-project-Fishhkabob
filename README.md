# AP Computer Science A Final Project
Name: Finnian McGarvey

Augmented Reality

Okayyyyy where to start. Heyo I'm Finn AKA Fishhkabob and a student at Grant highschool. This project is a weird one. Let's talk about Augmented Reality!
Augmented Reality, also known as AR is when you put a display over real life things I don't want to go full apple vision pro buuuut, I don't want to five minutes craft this shit. 
There are a multitude of ways to make AR ranging from a 20 dollar projector and car window tint, to tony stark jarvis style glasses
I'm just a highschooler not a literal super hero, but I'm also pretty invested in this so it's going to be somewhere in the middle. 
If I continue Computer Science next year you'll probably get to see a interactable AR display which would be cooool as shit in my opinion.

Prototyping:
For now I am going to be using safety glasses window tint and a low will to live.
It migghhhtttt take a while and realistically it's not gonna go aywhere in the six weeks I have until the end of school. So, it will project the time, day, and battery percentge as just purely proof of concept

V1:
planning to attactc a bulky ass 3d printed thingamabobber to the outside of my glasses with the same time, day, battery life.

V2: 
a more streamline mount upgrading to an arduino nano nd making the screen more customizable. new HUD features and possibly a small interactable camera.
Whatever I probs won't get here for a while



Concepts

These are the two possible concepts I'm working on but hey one may not work and the other one's complicated...  ffffuuuuccckkkkk

anyway
here you go ig?

Arduino controller design with a simulator :)

The code I ran today was to attempt to get a working timer displaed live through seconds, minutes, and hours...
it kinda failed but I'm gonna dump it here anyway


#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

int totalseconds = 0;

LiquidCrystal lcd_1(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);


void setup()
{
  lcd_1.begin(16, 2); // Set up the number of columns and rows on the LCD.

  // Print a message to the LCD.
  lcd_1.print("time: 12:00");
}

void loop()
{
int totalminutes = totalseconds/60;
int minutes = totalminutes % 60;
  int seconds = totalseconds % 60;
  lcd_1.setCursor(10, 0);
  
  lcd_1.print(minutes);
  lcd_1.print(seconds);

  delay(1000);
  totalseconds += 1;
  
  template<typename... Args>
std::string dyna_print(std::string_view rt_fmt_str, Args&&... args)
{
    return std::vformat(rt_fmt_str, std::make_format_args(args...));
}
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << std::format("Hello {}!\n", "world");
 
    std::string fmt;
    for (int i{}; i != 3; ++i)
    {
        fmt += "{} "; // constructs the formatting string
        std::cout << fmt << " : ";
        std::cout << dyna_print(fmt, "alpha", 'Z', 3.14, "unused");
        std::cout << '\n';
    }
}
}
